# Changelog

## [0.0.2](https://github.com/kausys/azync/compare/v0.0.2...v0.0.2) (2026-07-23)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* event.Envelope, queue.Job[T], queue.RawJob and event.Worker.Subscribe are removed; event.Subscriber is now the identity interface and the durable record is event.Subscription.

### Features

* deliver pure domain values to handlers with context metadata ([d5390cf](https://github.com/kausys/azync/commit/d5390cfe317fdd751f9614b868d09a51d976761d))
* initial release ([7dc21c0](https://github.com/kausys/azync/commit/7dc21c0d536b1a3049b94fd11cad660cecef3d3d))

## 0.0.2 (2026-07-23)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* handlers now receive the pure domain value; `event.Envelope`, `queue.Job[T]` and `queue.RawJob` are removed, and delivery/job metadata moved to the context accessors
* `event.Subscriber` is now the identity interface for worker registration; the durable catalog record was renamed to `event.Subscription`
* `event.Worker.Subscribe` was replaced by `Register` (interface + typed `On` bindings) and `RegisterFunc`

### Features

* typed event bindings: `event.On(fn)` infers the event type from the handler signature and decodes the payload before invoking it — no casts, no manual unmarshalling
* self-describing subscribers: `Worker.Register` upserts the durable subscription (subscriber × event types) idempotently on `Start`, so `Publisher.Register` is only needed for administrative registration
* context metadata accessors in both runtimes (`Attempt`, `IsRetry`, `Metadata`, `EventID`, `IsReplay`, `JobID`, `Kind`, ...) plus `DeliveryFromContext` / `JobFromContext` and `NewContext` helpers for testing handlers in isolation
* optional `MaxAttempts() int` on a subscriber overrides the runtime default for its durable subscriptions

### Documentation

* "Bring your own logger": wiring zap through its official `zapslog` bridge, silencing azync with `slog.DiscardHandler`, and pointers to zerolog/logrus bridges

## 0.0.1 (2026-07-23)


### Features

* durable background job queue: typed handlers, delayed and idempotent enqueue, and a retry taxonomy (Abort, Retry, RetryAfter, Reportable) on top of a deterministic exponential backoff
* durable CQRS event bus: atomic publish-and-fan-out to registered subscribers, backed by an insert-only ledger, with replay from history
* a single unified job table for queue jobs and event deliveries, sharing one schema, one migration and one admin surface
* PostgreSQL driver (`azyncpgx`) over pgx v5, with LISTEN/NOTIFY push wakeups, goose-based migrations and advisory-lock leader election for cron
* transactional enqueue and publish (`TxProducer`, `TxPublisher`) enlisting writes in the caller's own transaction for a true outbox
* a public driver conformance suite (`drivertest`) so third-party storage backends can validate themselves against the same contract the PostgreSQL driver is held to
* layered runtime configuration: shared `Core` defaults overridable per queue or event runtime, with lease fencing and a reaper proven by the conformance and integration suites
* admin surfaces (`Manager`) for both runtimes: inspection, retry, replay, pause/resume, purge, vacuum and stats
